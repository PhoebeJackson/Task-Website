# Task-Website
My first website, to schedule and organise tasks.
I decided to learn web design during lockdown 2020 and the result was this website!
I used html, php and javascript (all interactive features are in js not react since I wanted to test my understanding of js and learn as much of it as possible!).
I used a CSS file from Bootswatch and made some very tiny changes to it
